# üè† House Rent Predictor

This project uses a machine learning model to predict house and flat rents based on a variety of features. This is the core prediction engine for a future interactive chatbot application.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Predicts Monthly Rent:** Estimates rent based on features like city, size, BHK, and furnishing status.
-   **Trained Model:** Uses a Random Forest Regressor model trained on a real-world dataset.
-   **Ready for Use:** The trained model is saved and can be loaded for predictions.

## üíª Tech Stack

-   **Python**
-   **Pandas** for data manipulation
-   **Scikit-learn** for modeling
-   **Pickle** for saving the model
